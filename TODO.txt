CONFIG
  - better error checking in loadLib
  - scripts & modules reference each other.  general referential integrity?
  - make sure modreflib & scriptreflib are are referntially integral
	- if you re-use a module in a pattern, it's the same module!
	  - when creating modreflib, we could make new unique names.  the issue with that could be duplicate modules in the db.  but we could make a name from a hash of the values?

  - cleanup/finish parsing of libs & slibs
    - data on engine_conf/state, etc split across library, engine, config :/
    - general refactoring
    - clean up error messages
    - serializing / unifying with parsing
    - database support
    - library duplicates, namespace colissions & general library integrity
		- make sure library is immutable?
ENGINE
  - feedback isn't perfect/ misalligned square?
  - fract
  - better error checking
  - webgl debug statements?
UI
  - handle window resizing
  - fullscreen mode
  - remote control
PATTERN
  - pattern switching
  - derive module families & use indices
	- what order are scripts executed in?  right now it's kind of top down
MISC
  - only pass references when the function can mutate unless event handler or animator?
  - better use of type synonyms to clarify type annotations
  - complex numbers library?
  - make unsafe code safe + catch more errors

  - image support
  - build out library
  - feature parity with existing app
LATER
  - number parsing flakey?
  - engine stability/lost context - https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/WEBGL_lose_context/
  - compiler performance
  - compiler substitutions %XXXX%, etc can still cause errors
  - check out time vs requestAminFrame
  - error messages need more context
  - scritps for patterns?
  - module/submodule cycles??
  - module inheritence?
  - figure out how to render UI
  - build some kind of UI
  - video rendering
	- old style (automation) scripts
  - config/ lib file comments
  - detect system/perf profile
  - test on windows
  - test on ipad
  - test on android
	- https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/WEBGL_debug_shaders/
  - subsitiutions of the same name cant be used to derive library
	  - unit tests
  - website
  - logging system
  - programming guidelines document - i.e make sure all tree modifications rebuild mod ref lib
  - better kernel debug support
  - par & zn lengths are fixed
  - save images
  - webcam input
  - benchmarking tools
  - image comparison testing
