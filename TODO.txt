CONFIG
  - cleanup/finish parsing of libs & slibs
    - comments
    - data on engine_conf/state, etc split across library, engine, config :/
    - general refactoring
    - better error messages
    - serializing / unifying with parsing
    - database support
    - library duplicates, namespace colissions & general library integrity
		- make sure library is immutable
ENGINE
  - rebuild old main program

  - fract
  - indent spliced components
  - stop @@seed_w, @@seed_wt etc overlapping replacements from happening!
  - work on compiler performance
  - feedback isn't perfect/ misalligned square?
  - better error checking
  - webgl debug statements?
UI
  - figure out how to render UI
  - build some kind of UI
  - handle window resizing
  - fullscreen mode
PATTERN
  - scripts
  - derive module families & use indices
  - pattern switching
  - build out library
MISC
  - module inheritence?
  - better use of type synonyms to clarify type annotations
  - test on ipad
  - test on android
  - complex numbers library?
  - detect system/perf profile
  - only pass references when the function can mutate unless event handler or animator?
  - make unsafe code safe + catch more errors
LATER
  - subsitiutions of the same name cant be used to derive library
  - unit tests
  - website
  - logging system
  - programming guidelines document - i.e make sure all tree modifications rebuild mod ref lib
  - better kernel debug support
  - par & zn lengths are fixed
  - save images
  - webcam input
  - benchmarking tools
  - image comparison testing
