			<p>
				Epimorphism is a digital simulation of video feeback, a recursive process where a video animation is fed back into itself.  Video feedback is a pretty straightforward concept.  Just take a webcam & hook it up so that it's displaying on your computer, and then point the webcam at the display.  What happens is that in your display window you see what the camera is pointed at - the display  But you've just created an infinte loop!  In the display, you see a picture of the display.  In that display, you see another picture of the display...
			</p>

			<p>
				This project takes this process a few steps further.  Normal video feedback is interesting enough, but it lacks in precision, and is fairly limited in what you can do with it.  Epimorphism generalizes the whole process by simulating it, using a virtual camera which is pointed at a virtual screen.  We draw something on the screen, and then take a picture of it.  We bend and twist the picture in a bunch of mathematically interesting and precise ways, and then draw this picture back on the screen.  We then take a picture of that, bend and twist it again, draw that back on the screen...
			</p>

			<p>
				What you see happening is a steadily evolving feedback system.  The various ways in which we can bend and twist and process the image and the various images we draw into the system are constantly morphing into each other.  There are so many possible variations of how this happens that its basically impossible for the system to ever repeat.  Epimorphism exists in a state of continuous variation.  In fact if it had been runing since the beginning of time, it still wouldn't have repeated by now!

			<h3> Technical details </h3>

			<p>
				The current iteration of the project is written largely in PureScript, a dialect of Haskell.  The project is open source and can be found <a href="https://github.com/geneshuman/pure_morph"> here</a>.  The PureScript component of Epimorphism acts as the front end for a parallel/high performance computing application which runs directly on the clients graphics hardware via pixel shaders & WebGL.  The frontend of the application is responsible for the WebGL interface, application UI, pixel shader compilation, state evolution, and maintaining and modulating the pattern library.  The backend of the application is responsible for implementing the feedback transfer function above.  It is a highly parallel application, where the color value of each pixel is computed in its own thread directly on the graphics hardware.  The backend of the application is a highly parameterized system.  The default mode of operation of the system is a random walk through the parameter space; numerical parameters, as well as transfer functions themselves are animated and interpolated by the front end of the software.  Interactive modes of the software are also available, exposing the parameter space to the user.

			<h3> History/Future </h3>
			<p>
				The software has been in development in some form for ~10 years, and is currently in its 3rd major rewrite, with the majority of significant features from the previous applications largely functional. Significant near term plans for the software include audio responsiveness, a more detailed & user accessible creation UI, and implementing machine learning algorithms to more adeptly navigate the phase space of the software, possibly even tailoring the results to users individual tastes.  An algorithm to ray trace a generalized version of the software in 3 dimensions using distance fields has also been developed but technology is currently lacking.  However back of the envelope calculations suggest that consumer hardware is only about 2 generations away from being able to support this idea :)
